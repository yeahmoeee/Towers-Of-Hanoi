# Towers Of Hanoi

This is a simple modelling of the popular game Tower Of Hanoi using class-based Stack. 

Stack follows the LAST IN, FIRST OUT (LIFO).
Stack has a few operations associated with it: 
      - push (pushing data on the top of the stack)
      - pop  (popping data from the top of the stack)
      - peek (revealing the data on the top of the stack)
